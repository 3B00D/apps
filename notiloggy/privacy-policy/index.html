<p>NotiLoggy (“we,” “our,” or “the app”) is committed to protecting your
privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard
information when you use the NotiLoggy Android application.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>
<p>NotiLoggy is a notification history app that captures and stores
notifications on your device for your own reference. We prioritize your
privacy: <strong>notification content is stored only on your device and
is never transmitted to our servers or third parties</strong> for
purposes other than advertising (see Section 4).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="data-stored-on-your-device">2. Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
<h3 id="notification-data">2.1 Notification Data</h3>
<p>When you grant Notification Access, the app captures and stores: -
Notification title, body, and subtext - App package name - Timestamp</p>
<p>For notifications received while the app is running, we may also keep
<strong>in memory</strong> (not persisted to the database) the intent or
link that the original app associated with the notification. This allows
you to tap a notification in NotiLoggy to open the source app, an
external URL, or another app—depending on what the original notification
was designed to do. <strong>Tapping a notification may launch other apps
or open links.</strong> This behavior is handled entirely on your
device; we do not transmit intent or link data to our servers or any
external service.</p>
<p><strong>Storage:</strong> All notification data is stored
<strong>locally on your device</strong> in an <strong>encrypted
database</strong> (SQLCipher). We do not upload, transmit, or share this
data with our servers or any external service.</p>
<p><strong>Retention:</strong> You control how long notifications are
kept (1 day, 1 week, or 1 month). Older notifications are automatically
deleted. You can also clear all notifications at any time in Settings →
Data.</p>
<h3 id="app-preferences">2.2 App Preferences</h3>
<p>The app stores the following preferences locally, in encrypted
storage where possible: - Theme (light/dark/system) - Language -
Notification retention period - Excluded apps (apps whose notifications
you choose not to store) - App lock pattern (if enabled) - Premium/trial
status and purchase information (for Remove Ads)</p>
<p><strong>Storage:</strong> Preferences are stored on your device using
Android’s EncryptedSharedPreferences or equivalent secure storage.</p>

<h2 id="third-party-services">4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<h3 id="google-admob-advertising">4.1 Google AdMob (Advertising)</h3>
<p>The app displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob via
Firebase. When ads are shown: - <strong>AdMob</strong> may collect
device identifiers, IP address, and usage data to deliver and measure
ads. - <strong>Consent:</strong> In regions that require it (e.g., EEA,
UK), we use Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) to obtain your
consent before showing personalized ads. You can choose to limit or
refuse personalized advertising. - <strong>Privacy:</strong> AdMob’s
data practices are governed by <a
href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>
and <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">Google Ads
Privacy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Notification content is <strong>never</strong>
shared with AdMob or any ad network.</p>
<h3 id="google-play-billing">4.2 Google Play Billing</h3>
<p>If you purchase “Remove Ads” (premium), the transaction is processed
by Google Play. Google collects payment and purchase information
according to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Play’s
terms and privacy policy</a>. We receive only confirmation that your
purchase is valid; we do not receive your payment details.</p>
<h3 id="firebase">4.3 Firebase</h3>
<p>The app uses Firebase to support AdMob advertising. Firebase may
collect analytics and crash data. See <a
href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase
Privacy</a>.</p>

not appear in NotiLoggy regardless of your settings.</p>
<h3 id="advertising">6.2 Advertising</h3>

option to stop seeing ads entirely.</li>

based on your consent (e.g., ad consent) or to perform our contract with
you (provide the app). - You have the right to access, rectify, erase,
restrict processing, and data portability where applicable. - You may
withdraw consent at any time (e.g., for personalized ads). - You may
lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority.</p>
<h3 id="ccpa-california">6.4 CCPA (California)</h3>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify
you of material changes by updating the “Last updated” date and, where

policy.</p>
